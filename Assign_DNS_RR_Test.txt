- know how to use -it to get shell in container
- understand basics of what a linux distribution is like Ubuntu and CentOS
- know how to run a container
- understand basics of DNS records
 Tasks
1- ever since Docker Engine 1.11, we can have multiple containers on a created network respond to the same DNS address
2- Create a new virtual network (default bridge driver)
3- Create two containers from 'elastic search:2' image
4- Research and use '-network-alias search' when creating them to give them an additional DNS name to respond to
5- Run alpine nslookup search with --net to see the two containers list for the same DNS name
6- Run centos curl -s search:9200 with --net multiple times until see both 'name' fields show


==================
Create a network called dude
>> docker network create dude

Create 2 containers
Need to pull elastic search:2
>> docker pull --platform linux/x86_64 elasticsearch:2

Now create containers
>>  docker container run -d --net dude --network-alias search elasticsearch:2
Another time (these two is not same container)
>>  docker container run -d --net dude --network-alias search elasticsearch:2

========== These result won't work on m1 after above commands SECTION 3/34

>> docker container ls
